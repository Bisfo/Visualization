## Mantras:
(from [ITP / James](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2019-Media))
* "Practice is the best of all instructors." - computation requires practice
* "An agreeable companion on a journey is as good as a carriage." - look to your classmates for help too
* "While we stop to think, we often miss our opportunity." - sometimes you need to take a leap of faith
* "When two do the same thing, it is not the same thing after all." - encourage students with similar ideas
* "The bow too tensely strung is easily broken." - don't get too stressed out
All of these are from Plubius Syrus.(42 B.C.)
