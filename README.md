# Interactive Data Visualisation
Taught by [Annelie Berner](http://www.annelieberner.com/) at the [The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts](https://kadk.dk/en/programme/visuelt-design) 

March 10 - April 3rd, 2020  

## Description:  
In this course we will 

## Brief:
In this course (2020), we focus on 
Data:
Climate:
Futures:

## Main Topics:  
* Interactive data visualisation
* Programming, troubleshooting
* Programming for the web
* D3.js
* Data visualisation processes
* Storytelling
* Visual encoding
* Data and Ethics

## Our Expectations:  
* Each week's plan and the accompanying assignments will shift slightly to accommodate the pace of the learners.
* Attendance is mandatory. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class.
* This class is participatory. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects.

* You will gain resources to dive deeper in the future
* It takes years to get familiar with code so expect to hit your head against your computer for many hours.
* Expect to ask for and give help.
* Breaks are good. Take as many water, stretching and bathroom breaks as you need

## Documentation:  
* Turn your assignments in by Monday every week.
* Keep your blog up to date with the work you did in-class and/or in the assignments.

## Resources
* Resource list [here](https://github.com/aberner6/kadk-data-vis/blob/master/resources.md)

## Student Work
* We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments. Feel free to use your preferred platform for the blog - for example, tumblr. You can also make your own "blog-like" spot - for example, google slides, docs, etc. - as long as it is online.

# Schedule
Every day, we will go through some variation of: 
* inspiration - review - code - design - theory - exercises - wrap-up
We will timebox, which means that we will get to wherever we get to within each topic/day and some may roll over into the next or some may be achieved more quickly in which case we will move forward
