## Description:  
In this course we will 

## Brief:
In this course (2020), we focus on 
Data:
Climate:
Futures:

## Main Topics:  
* Interactive data visualisation
* Programming, troubleshooting
* Programming for the web
* D3.js
* Data visualisation processes
* Storytelling
* Visual encoding
* Data and Ethics

## Expectations:  
* Each week's plan and the accompanying assignments will shift slightly to accommodate the pace of the learners
* You will gain a basic understanding of how to create interactive, web-based data visualisations
* You will gain resources to dive deeper in the future
* It takes years to get familiar with code
* Expect to hit your head against your computer for many hours
* Expect to ask for help
* Expect to give help

## Hygiene:  
* Turn your assignments in by Monday every week
* Every input to assignments should be posted on your blog 
* Come on time to class
* Feel free to take as many water, stretching and bathroom breaks as you need
